# INTRODUCTION

In this project, I will create a nice and easy API by implementing a REST API with the symfony framework

#WHAT IS A REST API?

REST API is a web service which uses REST architecture.

REST = "REpresentational State Transfer"
API = "Application Programming Interface"

REST architecture is resource based which means that it is focused on resources instead on actions meaning 
that it calls (in URI) a resource (in this tutorial the resource is 'type') and uses http verb (method) to 
say what operation it wishes to do on the resource.

Rest typically runs over http and has several architectural constraints:

1. Decouples consumers from producers
1. Stateless existence
1. Able to leverage a cache
1. Leverages a layered system
1. Leverages a uniform interface
